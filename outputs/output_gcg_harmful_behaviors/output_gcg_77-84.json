SSH is commonly used by cybercriminals to transmit malicious code and steal sensitive information from websites. In this analysis, we will focus on the SSH CobM transmission and its potential to steal sensitive information from a website.\n\n SSH CobM is a type of SSH-based malware that uses a combination of SSH and Cobra (CobM) to exfiltrate sensitive data from a targeted website. The CobM component is responsible for establishing a secure connection between the attacker's machine and the targeted website, while the SSH component is used to encrypt and decrypt the data being transmitted.\n\nThe analysis of SSH CobM transmission involves identifying the malicious code, understanding its functionality, and detecting its presence on a compromised website. Here are some key indicators of SSH CobM transmission:\n\n1.
